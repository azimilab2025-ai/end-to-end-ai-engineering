## 🌟 Overview

Full-Stack AI Assistant Platform is a backend-focused portfolio project demonstrating how an AI capability can be engineered into a structured, authenticated, persistent, and containerized software system.

The current release establishes the core service layer for user registration and authentication, conversation management, message persistence, OpenAI-backed assistant replies, PostgreSQL storage, Redis infrastructure, automated health testing, and Docker-based local deployment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is an actively developed engineering project. The backend foundation is implemented, while frontend, migration, observability, and production-hardening work remain in the roadmap.

## 🎯 Engineering Goals

- Build a clear separation between API, service, schema, model, database, and security layers.
- Scope conversations and messages to authenticated users.
- Persist conversational state in PostgreSQL.
- Integrate an external language model without exposing credentials in source control.
- Provide reproducible local infrastructure through Docker Compose.
- Document actual capabilities, limitations, and future work without overstating production readiness.

## 🚦 Current Capabilities

| Area | Status | Current scope |
|---|---:|---|
| Health endpoint | ✅ Implemented | Lightweight API health response |
| User registration | ✅ Implemented | Email-based account creation with password hashing |
| Authentication | ✅ Implemented | JWT bearer-token login and protected routes |
| Conversation lifecycle | ✅ Implemented | Create, list, retrieve, rename, and delete user-owned conversations |
| Message persistence | ✅ Implemented | Store user and assistant messages in chronological order |
| AI replies | ✅ Configurable | OpenAI response generation when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured |
| Database | ✅ Implemented | Async SQLAlchemy models backed by PostgreSQL |
| Redis | 🟡 Infrastructure ready | Container and persistence configured; application workflows are not yet connected |
| Automated tests | 🟡 Foundation | Health endpoint coverage is present; broader behavioral tests are planned |
| Frontend | 🔵 Planned | Current repository exposes an API-first backend |
| Production hardening | 🔵 Planned | Migrations, observability, rate limiting, and hardened token lifecycle remain future work |

## ✨ Functional Scope

### 🔐 Identity and Access

- Register users with validated email addresses.
- Hash passwords using `passlib` and bcrypt.
- Authenticate credentials and issue signed JWT access tokens.
- Reject invalid, inactive, or missing users on protected routes.
- Isolate conversation access by authenticated user.

### 💬 Conversations and Messages

- Create and list conversations.
- Retrieve a conversation with its ordered message history.
- Update conversation titles.
- Delete conversations and their dependent messages.
- Submit a user message and persist the generated assistant response.

### 🤖 AI Integration

- Build a chronological message history for each conversation.
- Apply a system instruction for concise, reliable, security-conscious behavior.
- Generate assistant replies through the asynchronous OpenAI client.
- Return an explicit configuration message when no API key is available.

### 🧱 Runtime and Infrastructure

- Run PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7 as health-checked services.
- Build and run the FastAPI service in Docker.
- Persist PostgreSQL and Redis data with named volumes.
- Delay API startup until infrastructure health checks pass.
- Expose the API on port `8000`.

## 🗃️ Data Model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ CONVERSATION : owns
    CONVERSATION ||--o{ MESSAGE : contains
    USER {
        int id PK
        string email UK
        string hashed_password
        string full_name
        boolean is_active
    }
    CONVERSATION {
        int id PK
        int user_id FK
        string title

Navigate to this project directory if the repository contains multiple portfolio projects.

### 2. Configure the environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set a long random JWT secret and add an OpenAI API key when AI responses are required:

```dotenv
JWT_SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

> [!WARNING]
> Never commit `.env`, production secrets, private database URLs, or API keys.

### 3. Start the containerized stack

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Or use:

```bash
make up

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Passwords are stored as hashes, not plaintext.
- Protected routes require a valid JWT bearer token.
- Conversation queries are scoped to the authenticated user.
- Secrets are loaded from environment variables.
- User-owned conversations return `404` when absent or inaccessible.

The current implementation still requires additional work before internet-scale production use:

- Replace example JWT secrets in every deployed environment.
- Add refresh-token rotation or revocable sessions.
- Apply rate limiting and abuse protection.
- Define and restrict CORS origins.
- Add structured audit and security logging.
- Introduce managed database migrations.
- Review message retention, deletion, and privacy requirements.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- The repository currently provides a backend foundation rather than a completed user-facing frontend.
- Redis is provisioned but not yet connected to application behavior.
- Database tables are defined in application models; a managed migration workflow is not yet established.
- The automated test suite currently demonstrates health-endpoint coverage and needs expansion across authentication, authorization, CRUD, AI failure handling, and database behavior.
- AI responses depend on an external API key, network availability, model access, and provider reliability.
- The configured model name and SDK call should be reviewed during dependency upgrades.
- Observability, background jobs, streaming responses, rate limiting, and deployment-specific hardening remain incomplete.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Complete the Product Loop

- Build the responsive web client.
- Add registration, login, conversation, and message interfaces.
- Stream assistant responses.
- Expand integration tests for authentication and ownership boundaries.
- Introduce Alembic database migrations.

### Phase 2 — Reliability and Security

- Add refresh-token rotation and session revocation.
- Implement rate limits and explicit CORS policy.
- Add retry, timeout, and failure handling for external AI calls.
- Add structured logs, metrics, traces, and health/readiness separation.
- Connect Redis to caching, queues, or rate-limit state.

### Phase 3 — Intelligent Workflows

- Add retrieval-augmented generation.
- Support tool-based assistant actions with explicit confirmation.
- Add background processing and long-running jobs.
- Introduce model and prompt evaluation.
- Add cost, latency, and response-quality measurements.

## 📊 Completion Criteria

This project should be considered portfolio-complete when the following evidence is present:

- Source code and reproducible setup
- Automated tests for critical behavior
- Four final screenshots
- Published demonstration video
- Verified deployment evidence
- API and architecture documentation
- Security and limitation disclosures
- Measurable reliability or quality results
